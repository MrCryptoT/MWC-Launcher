# MWC Launcher

A Script to Wrap around the MWC Wallet and MWC Node to make transactions easier using the CLI Wallet

*IMPORTANT:* 
DONT SHARE YOUR BATCHFILES
TAKE SECURITY SERIOUS! STAY SAFE
 
 ## How to use
 1) Copy the Launcher.bat into the same Directory as your mwc-wallet.exe and mwc.exe and ngrok.exe
 2) Edit Variable to match your password (And Directories if they are not in the same one)
 3) Doubleclick "Launcher.bat" 
 4) Follow the Instructions on Screen (To Interact just type the letters in parenthesis)
 
 This script assumes the following: 
 Launcher.bat, MWC-Wallet.exe and MWC.exe are all in the same Folder!
 If this is true, only edit the pw and your set to go!
 
 ###  Replace the following Variables ONLY if Needed:
- NodeLocation = PathofyourNodeDirectory
- WalletLocation = PathofyourCLIWallet
- NgrokLocation = PathofNgrok
- TransactionFilename = Whatevernameyourtransactionfilesshouldhave
- Responsefilename = thenameofyourreceivedresposefile
- Debugmode = TRUE/FALSE (TRUE displays more detailed Information)
- CloseFast = TRUE/FALSE (TRUE skips warning before closing and just quit quickly)

	
Remarks: 
Responsefiles might differ from Exchange to exchange, I just assume Names in this Script
Manual CLI might still be faster for finalizing.

This Project Includes an Exe File I deployed, to get a Fully wrapped Version without some Minor Improvements, just download Whiney Weasel (V0.4)
